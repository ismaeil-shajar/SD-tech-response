## Introduction

This documentation provides guidelines and requirements for clients who wish to integrate their services with the Central Hub. The Central Hub is designed to enable seamless interaction between multiple services and support various channels, including web interfaces, USSD, and mobile apps.

## System Architecture Overview

The Central Hub employs a scalable and flexible architecture that supports service integration and management. The architecture relies on Java, Kafka, and gRPC for messaging and communication. It is serverless, leveraging technologies like AWS Lambda for efficient resource management. The system is containerized and cloud-compatible, initially hosted on AWS outside Sudan.

A local cloud provider in Sudan may be considered to provide a proxy inside the country. This would enable tunneling the application into Sudan when the internet is blocked and allow operation on the local network.

## API Specification

### General API Structure

The API payloads should follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "requestId": "unique_request_id",
  "service": "service_name",
  "operation": "operation_name",
  "timestamp": "request_timestamp",
  "data": {
    // service-specific data
  },
  "metadata": {
    // additional information, if needed
  }
}
```
### Authentication and Authorization

Clients must provide and implement a secure authentication and authorization mechanism for their services. This may include using API keys, OAuth 2.0, or other token-based systems.

### Error Handling and Reporting

Clients should ensure that their services handle errors gracefully and return informative error messages. The Central Hub will follow standard HTTP status codes for error reporting.

## Client Onboarding and Requirements

### Integration Requirements

Clients must adhere to the following requirements for integration with the Central Hub:

1. Provide detailed documentation about their services, including API specifications, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and data formats.
2. Conform to the integration guidelines and API design principles specified in this documentation.
3. Implement necessary changes to ensure seamless integration with the Central Hub.

### API Documentation and Examples

Clients should provide API documentation and examples to facilitate smooth integration with the Central Hub.

### Support and Communication Channels

Clients should establish support and communication channels to address any issues or concerns during the integration process.
