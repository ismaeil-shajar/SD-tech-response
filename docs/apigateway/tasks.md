## Kanban User Stories

### Research

1. Research optimal load balancing strategies for the Central Hub.
2. Research available technologies for serverless architecture (e.g. AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions).
3. Investigate the feasibility of using a local cloud provider in Sudan for proxying and tunneling.
4. Research authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure API access.
5. Explore containerization and cloud compatibility options (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes).

### Backend Development

1. Design and implement the API gateway with support for multiple service integrations.
2. Implement chosen authentication and authorization mechanisms.
3. Implement the service registry for storing available service configurations.
4. Develop the logic for routing requests based on service configuration and load balancing strategy.
5. Implement the serverless architecture using the chosen technology (e.g. AWS Lambda).
6. Containerize the application and ensure cloud compatibility.
7. Set up the necessary infrastructure for proxying and tunneling with a local cloud provider in Sudan.

### Frontend Development

1. Develop a web interface for managing service configurations and monitoring the Central Hub.
2. Create a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing metrics and performance data.
3. Implement the necessary UI components for managing authentication and authorization settings.

### Testing

1. Create unit tests for backend components, including routing logic and service registry.
2. Develop integration tests for the entire Central Hub system, including the API gateway, load balancing strategies, and service integrations.
3. Perform load and stress testing to ensure the system can handle high traffic and scale accordingly.

### Documentation

1. Document the API specifications, including endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication/authorization requirements.
2. Write detailed documentation on the Central Hub's architecture, components, and design choices.
3. Create user guides and tutorials for developers who wish to integrate their services with the Central Hub.
